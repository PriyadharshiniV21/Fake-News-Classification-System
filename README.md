# Fake News Classification System

The Fake News Classification System project showcases my expertise in Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Streamlit to address the critical issue of distinguishing between fake and real news articles. The project initiated with meticulous text pre-processing using NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stop words removal, enhancing the quality and relevance of the textual data.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the data, I employed visualization frameworks such as seaborn, along with creating word clouds and style clouds. These visualizations not only facilitated a deeper exploration of the dataset but also offered insights into the patterns and characteristics of fake and real news articles.

For the core machine learning aspect, I transformed the text data into numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer, a crucial step in preparing the data for model training. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were implemented for classification. Notably, the XGBoost algorithm outperformed others, achieving an impressive accuracy score of 96.6%.

To ensure the accessibility and practical application of the model, I saved it in a joblib file, allowing for easy retrieval and reuse. Taking it a step further, I developed a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for seamless model deployment. This not only demonstrated the functionality and accuracy of the classification model but also highlighted its practicality through an intuitive interface.

The Fake News Classification System project not only showcases my technical proficiency but also underscores my commitment to addressing real-world challenges using advanced technologies. This endeavor exemplifies the successful integration of machine learning, NLP, and web deployment to contribute towards mitigating the spread of misinformation in the digital landscape.
